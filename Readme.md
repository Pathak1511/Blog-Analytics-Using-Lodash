[Problem Statement](https://github.com/Pathak1511/Blog-Analytics-Using-Lodash/blob/main/problemStatement.md)

##### Overview

The Blog Search API allows you to search for blogs based on a query string. It provides a simple and efficient way to filter blogs from a remote source based on the provided search criteria.

##### Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The API is built using Node.js, a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side.
- **Express**: We use the Express.js framework to create and manage API routes and handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Axios**: Axios is used to make HTTP requests to a remote server, specifically to fetch the list of blogs for searching.
- **Lodash**: Lodash is used for various utility functions, including memoization for caching analytics and search results.
- **JSON**: Data is exchanged in JSON format, which is a lightweight and easy-to-parse data interchange format.

##### Endpoint
